Vessel,SMS,No,3/17/2025 21:25,"Subject: Email TCK-54787 | Vessel MV ADRIAN MAERSK/002E exception at PSA Portnet

Dear Team,

HI Team,
Similar with previous case: CS0053439-INC0159773/L where we have duplicate system Vessel Name.
Please assist to change system Vessel Name for new ADRIAN MAERSK with callsign OZUU2 to be ADRIAN MSK i/o ADRIAN MS to avoid same name with callsign 5LLT3 as showing error on below screenshot while creating new Vessel Advice.

Please review the case and provide a resolution at the earliest. Kindly escalate if necessary.

Best Regards,","Issue:
Similar to the previous case CS0053439-INC0159773/L, a duplicate system vessel name exists for MV ADRIAN MAERSK with callsign OZUU2.
There is a conflict between this vessel and another with callsign 5LLT3, causing an error while creating a new Vessel Advice.
The team requests to change the system vessel name to ADRIAN MSK to avoid conflicts.","Identify Duplicate Vessel Name:
Review the system or vessel management platform to confirm that the conflict exists between ADRIAN MAERSK and ADRIAN MS due to the same vessel name but different callsigns.
Check if the system flags the duplicate vessel name and lists both callsigns under similar entries.
Update Vessel Name in the System:
Change the system vessel name for ADRIAN MAERSK (OZUU2) to ADRIAN MSK directly in the vessel management interface. This can be done through the system's Vessel Details page or name edit feature if available.
Ensure that the name change reflects in all associated platforms, including Vessel Advice creation and Vessel Registration.
Verify the Fix and Resubmit Vessel Advice:
After making the name change, test the process by creating a new Vessel Advice for ADRIAN MSK.
Confirm that the error no longer occurs. If the issue persists, escalate to the technical support team for a deeper investigation.",

Audit trail reveals a late yard move event, potentially overwritten by an older milestone. Booking BK-1N6KVPUC and seal S2625-8HH included (randomized placeholders). Yard crane QC15 handled the last move at PSA Pasir Panjang.

Please review the case and provide a resolution at the earliest. Kindly escalate if necessary.

The berth creation for MV PORT KELANG EXPRESS (W184) at PSA Keppel was initially created with the voyages W183/W183. However, the voyage was later changed to E183/W183 before being reverted back.
The team is requesting to identify who made the amendment to ensure internal accountability.","Check System Logs:
Review the system logs or audit trail for the berth creation process to identify who made the changes to the voyage details.
Action: Search for voyage change history in the system logs.
Verify User Permissions:
If logs indicate a change, check the user permissions for those involved in the process to confirm who had access to amend voyage details.
Action: Cross-check with the system’s user activity logs.
Escalate if Needed:
If the information cannot be found, escalate to the system admin team for further investigation. They can trace system-level changes and provide more details.",

Check the system or database to confirm if the TLI for SPIRIT OF BERTRAM has been declared or logged correctly. This involves querying the TLI database or TLI submission system.
Review the TLI Submission Process:
Investigate the TLI submission process to identify if the TLI was missed due to manual errors or system failures. Verify if there was any API failure or data sync issue preventing the TLI from being properly logged.
Check for Additional Costs:
Determine if there are additional charges tied to the missing TLI. This could involve checking the billing system for any fees or penalties associated with late declarations.
Resolve System Sync Issues (if applicable):
If the missing TLI is due to a system sync issue, work with the IT team to resolve any data inconsistencies between the TLI declaration system and the billing system to prevent further discrepancies.",

We are encountering an ETA/ETB mismatch for MV SUNRISE REEF (IMO 1851952, CS-WWYRA) on voyage 211S. The berth plan indicates an ETB at TU13, but TOS shows a discrepancy of over 90 minutes due to tidal constraints. Additionally, the partner portal still reflects the outdated ETA, and the yard resource plan at PSA Keppel is displaying older figures.

Furthermore, the pilotage request is pending, and the quay Q4 crane allocation is misaligned.

Please review the situation and provide a resolution as soon as possible. If escalation is necessary, kindly proceed accordingly.

Best Regards,","ETA/ETB Mismatch:
The TOS shows a 90-minute discrepancy with the berth plan’s ETB due to tidal constraints. This may be due to incorrect system calculations or data sync issues.
Outdated ETA on Partner Portal:
The Partner Portal is displaying outdated ETA, indicating a potential sync failure between TOS and the portal.
Yard Resource Plan:
PSA Keppel’s yard plan shows old figures, likely due to data refresh or sync issues from the TOS.
Pending Pilotage Request:
The pilotage request is still pending, possibly due to a workflow processing issue in the vessel scheduling system.
Misaligned Crane Allocation:
The Q4 crane allocation is misaligned, possibly due to resource scheduling errors in the TOS.","Fix ETA/ETB Mismatch:
Verify sync between TOS and berth plan; ensure tidal constraints are factored into ETA/ETB calculations.
Update Partner Portal ETA:
Investigate TOS to Partner Portal sync issues and ensure real-time updates for ETA.
Revise Yard Resource Plan:
Check the data refresh mechanism for PSA Keppel’s yard plan to ensure it reflects the latest figures.
Process Pilotage Request:
Identify and resolve workflow bottlenecks causing delays in the pilotage request processing.
